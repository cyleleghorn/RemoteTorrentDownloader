#RemoteTorrentDownloader

This is a tool I created in my free time to allow people with media servers the ability to let their friends
remotely add content into the server.  There is another half, the server program, that must run on the same
computer as the media server to accept incoming connections and initiate downloads.

The basic usage is as follows:
1. Enter the name of a movie or TV show, and click search.
2. The request is sent to the server program, which gets results from www.ThePirateBay.org and returns them
   to this program.  This allows the program to be used from locations which block access to The Pirate Bay.
3. Check the files you would like to download, select whether they are movies or TV shows, then click download.

The server half of the program will initiate the downloads, placing them into predetermined folders that the
media server reads from based on whether you selected "Movie" or "TV Show" from the drop down box.

I will continue to update this program occasionally to keep up with the server program, but most of the effort
will go towards adding features to that half from now on.
